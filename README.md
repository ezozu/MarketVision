# MarketVision: Real-Time Market Data Analysis in Rust

MarketVision is a high-performance, real-time market data analysis tool built in Rust. It provides robust data ingestion, efficient processing, and flexible output capabilities for traders, analysts, and developers who need to make data-driven decisions rapidly. This project aims to deliver a scalable and reliable solution for handling high-volume market data streams.

MarketVision is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional market data platforms, often hampered by performance bottlenecks and inflexible architectures. Using Rust's memory safety, concurrency features, and zero-cost abstractions, MarketVision achieves exceptional performance and resource utilization. It provides a modular architecture, allowing users to customize data ingestion sources, processing pipelines, and output destinations according to their specific needs. The core of MarketVision is built around asynchronous processing, enabling the system to handle thousands of concurrent data streams without significant performance degradation.

The key benefit of MarketVision lies in its ability to process and analyze market data in real-time. It can be configured to monitor specific market events, calculate key performance indicators (KPIs), and generate alerts based on predefined thresholds. This enables users to react quickly to market changes, optimize trading strategies, and minimize potential risks. MarketVision also offers comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities, allowing users to track system performance, identify potential issues, and ensure data integrity. Finally, its flexible architecture makes it easy to integrate with existing trading systems and analytical tools.

## Key Features

*   **High-Performance Data Ingestion:** Utilizes asynchronous I/O with Tokio to handle multiple data streams concurrently. Supports various data formats, including FIX, Binary, and CSV, with customizable parsing logic through a modular codec architecture. The system uses `tokio::net::TcpStream` and `tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt}` for asynchronous network operations.
*   **Real-Time Data Processing:** Employs a multi-threaded processing pipeline built with Rust's `std::thread` and `crossbeam-channel` for efficient data handling. Customizable data processing modules can be chained together to perform complex calculations and transformations on market data. These modules expose a clear API using traits for easy extension.
*   **Flexible Output Options:** Supports various output destinations, including databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, InfluxDB), message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ), and real-time charting libraries. Provides a configurable output adapter pattern to easily add new output destinations without modifying the core processing logic. The output adapter is implemented using traits, making it extremely flexible.
*   **Alerting System:** Implements a rule-based alerting system that triggers notifications based on predefined market conditions. Rules are defined using a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that allows users to specify complex market events and thresholds. The alerting system uses `regex` crate for pattern matching and `chrono` crate for time-based conditions.
*   **Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring:** Provides detailed logging using the `log` and `tracing` crates. System metrics, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and data throughput, are exposed through a Prometheus endpoint. These metrics are gathered using the `prometheus` crate.
*   **Configurable Data Filters:** Allows users to filter incoming data based on specific criteria, such as instrument symbols or exchange identifiers. Filters are implemented using a configurable expression language, allowing for complex filter logic to be defined at runtime. The filtering logic is evaluated using a custom interpreter.
*   **Data Aggregation:** Enables users to aggregate market data over different time intervals (e.g., minute bars, hourly bars). Aggregation is performed using a sliding window algorithm, ensuring that calculations are performed efficiently and accurately. The windowed data is stored using a time-series database interface.

## Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** The core programming language providing memory safety, concurrency, and performance.
*   **Tokio:** An asynchronous runtime for building scalable network applications. Used for handling data ingestion and network communication.
*   **Crossbeam:** A concurrency library providing synchronization primitives for efficient multi-threaded data processing.
*   **PostgreSQL/InfluxDB:** Relational and time-series databases used for storing and querying market data.
*   **Kafka/RabbitMQ:** Message queues used for distributing market data to downstream systems.
*   **Prometheus:** A monitoring system used for collecting and exposing system metrics.
*   **Log/Tracing:** Rust crates for logging and tracing application execution.
*   **Regex:** A crate for regular expression matching, utilized in the alerting system.
*   **Chrono:** A crate for date and time manipulation, used for time-based conditions.

## Installation

1.  **Install Rust:** Ensure you have a stable version of Rust installed. You can download and install Rust from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/MarketVision.git
    cd MarketVision
3.  **Build the Project:**
    cargo build --release
    This will build the project in release mode, optimizing for performance.
4.  **Install Dependencies (Optional):** Depending on the output destinations you plan to use, you may need to install additional dependencies, such as database drivers or message queue clients. Refer to the documentation for each output destination for specific installation instructions. For example, if you plan to use PostgreSQL, install the `libpq-dev` package.
5. **Database Setup:** If using a database output, create the necessary database and tables. The schema will depend on your chosen data storage format. Example Postgres command: `CREATE DATABASE marketvision;`

## Configuration

MarketVision utilizes environment variables for configuration. The following environment variables are supported:

*   `DATA_SOURCE_TYPE`: Specifies the type of data source (e.g., "FIX", "CSV"). Default is "CSV".
*   `DATA_SOURCE_URL`: Specifies the URL or path to the data source.
*   `OUTPUT_DESTINATION_TYPE`: Specifies the type of output destination (e.g., "PostgreSQL", "Kafka"). Default is "PostgreSQL".
*   `OUTPUT_DESTINATION_URL`: Specifies the URL or connection string for the output destination.
*   `ALERT_THRESHOLD`: The threshold value for triggering alerts.
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the logging level (e.g., "debug", "info", "warn", "error"). Default is "info".

Example:
DATA_SOURCE_TYPE=FIX
DATA_SOURCE_URL=tcp://example.com:10000
OUTPUT_DESTINATION_TYPE=PostgreSQL
OUTPUT_DESTINATION_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
ALERT_THRESHOLD=100

## Usage

1.  **Run the Application:**
    target/release/marketvision
2.  **Data Ingestion:** MarketVision will automatically start ingesting data from the configured data source.
3.  **Data Processing:** The ingested data will be processed through the configured pipeline.
4.  **Output:** The processed data will be written to the configured output destination.
5.  **API Documentation:** (Assume a basic API exists for demonstration)
    MarketVision provides a basic API for querying the processed data. You can access the API through a REST interface.
    *   `GET /data?symbol=AAPL`: Returns the latest market data for Apple (AAPL).
    *   `GET /alerts`: Returns a list of triggered alerts.
